@upstash/qstash is the official client and consumer for [QStash](https://chronark.com/projects/qstash).

QStash is the message broker between your serverless apps. You send an HTTP
request to QStash, that includes a destination, a payload and optional settings.
We durably store your message and will deliver it to the destination API via
HTTP. In case the destination is not ready to receive the message, we will retry
the message later, to guarentee at-least-once delivery.

```bash
npm install @upstash/qstash
```
