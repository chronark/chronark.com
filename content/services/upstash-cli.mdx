## Usage

Let's create a new redis database:

```bash
> upstash redis create --name=my-db --region=eu-west-1
  Database has been created

  database_id          a3e25299-132a-45b9-b026-c73f5a807859
  database_name        my-db
  database_type        Pay as You Go
  region               eu-west-1
  type                 paid
  port                 37090
  creation_time        1652687630
  state                active
  password             88ae6392a1084d1186a3da37fb5f5a30
  user_email           andreas@upstash.com
  endpoint             eu1-magnetic-lacewing-37090.upstash.io
  edge                 false
  multizone            false
  rest_token           AZDiASQgYTNlMjUyOTktMTMyYS00NWI5LWIwMjYtYzczZjVhODA3ODU5ODhhZTYzOTJhMTA4NGQxMTg2YTNkYTM3ZmI1ZjVhMzA=
  read_only_rest_token ApDiASQgYTNlMjUyOTktMTMyYS00NWI5LWIwMjYtYzczZjVhODA3ODU5O_InFjRVX1XHsaSjq1wSerFCugZ8t8O1aTfbF6Jhq1I=


  You can visit your database details page: https://console.upstash.com/redis/a3e25299-132a-45b9-b026-c73f5a807859

  Connect to your database with redis-cli: redis-cli -u redis://88ae6392a1084d1186a3da37fb5f5a30@eu1-magnetic-lacewing-37090.upstash.io:37090
```

## Output

Most commands support the `--json` flag to return the raw api response as json,
which you can parse and automate your system.

```bash
> upstash  redis create --name=test2113 --region=us-central1 --json | jq '.endpoint'

 "gusc1-clean-gelding-30208.upstash.io"
```
