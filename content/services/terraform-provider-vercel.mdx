Back in the day when Vercel didn't have an official Terraform provider, I wrote one. 
I needed to manage my Vercel projects and especially sync environment variables from different cloud providers.
Terraform was great to provision some postgres databases on digital ocean, but there was no way to sync the credentials with Vercel.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    vercel = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/chronark/vercel"
      version = ">=0.10.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "vercel" {
  token = "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
}

resource "vercel_project" "my_project" {
  name = "project-via-terraform"
  git_repository {
    type = "github"
    repo = "chronark/terraform-provider-vercel"
  }
}
```

It was a fun project and I learned a lot about Terraform and Vercel's API. 
It gave me the opportunity to contribute to the Terraform ecosystem and my appreciation for the work that the Terraform team does is immense.

There have been quite a few individuals and teams that have used this provider and I am happy that it has been useful to you.

Now that Vercel have stepped in, I have decided to [deprecate](https://twitter.com/chronark_/status/1517759708983177218) this one on April 23rd 2022. 

Please use the [official provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/vercel/vercel/latest) instead.
