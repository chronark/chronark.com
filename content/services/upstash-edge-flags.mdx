Whether you want to ship without breaking things, run A/B tests or just want to test in production,
feature flags are a great way to dynamically change the behaviour of your app without redeploying. We're excited to announce the public
beta release of our new feature flagging library: [@upstash/edge-flags](https://github.com/upstash/edge-flags).

*Edge Flags*, as the name implies, is a feature flag solution built to run at the edge. It is using [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/), a globally replicated serverless Redis service, to store configuration and is 
designed to work with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com). We want to support other frameworks in the future, so if you have a suggestion, please let us know!

With the ability to toggle features on and off at the edge, you can quickly respond
to user feedback and optimize the user experience. Whether you are looking to
perform A/B testing, gradually roll out a new feature, or simply have the
ability to turn things off in case of an issue, our feature flagging library has
you covered.
