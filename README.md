# Txsoura Open Source
I forked this project from [![Andreas Thomas](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/chronark/chronark.com?style=social)](https://GitHub.com/chronark/chronark.com/network/), so if you want the original project (without my changes), contribute, support or sponsor, go to his profile.


This was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Upstash](https://upstash.com?ref=chronark.com), [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
